# Movie Search App


## Description

This is a movie search web application that interacts with the OMDB API to allow users to search for movies, TV series, and episodes by title or keyword. The app includes several features such as filtering by movie type, pagination for large result sets, infinite scroll, and detailed views for individual movies. The app is built using React, Axios, Tailwind CSS, and React Router for client-side routing.

## Features

- **Movie Search:** Users can search for movies, series, or episodes by entering a title or keyword.

- **Starred Movies:** Star and unstar movies, with the starred list stored in localStorage for persistence.

- **Infinite Scroll:** The app supports paginated search results or infinite scroll, allowing users to browse through large datasets.
  
- **Detailed Movie View:** Each movie or series has a detailed view showing a larger poster, title, release year, genre, plot summary, ratings, and cast.
  
- **Search State Preservation:** When viewing movie details, users can return to the same search results without losing their search term, filters, or current page.
  
- **Error Handling:** Displays user-friendly error messages for cases such as no results found, API request failures, etc.

- **OMDB API:** External API for fetching movie, series, and episode data.
